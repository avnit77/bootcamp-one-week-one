    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="ferns">
     Here are a few things you should definitely know about me:
      <ul>
        <li>I like ferns. Especially raggedy sword ferns. They remind me of being in a forest. You get it.</li>
        <li>One time I built a swing and hung it in the forest. For swinging and marvelling at ferns.</li>
        <li>When I was in Puerto Rico, I hiked around a rainforest for the first time. There were also ferns there, but they were WEIRD and TROPICAL.</li>
      </ul>
