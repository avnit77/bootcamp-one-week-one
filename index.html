     Here are a few things you should definitely know about me:
      <ul>
        <li>I like ferns. Especially raggedy sword ferns. They remind me of being in a forest. Sure, there are also lots of trees in forests, but I tend to be looking closer to where my feet are supposed to land <em>(the ground)</em> and you know what I see down there? Ferns. You get it.</li>
        <li>One time I built a really big swing and hung it in a forest. With this technology, I was able to swing with my friends while marvelling at the forest, or fern-city, as I've heard some call it.</li>
        <li>When I was in Puerto Rico, I hiked around a rainforest for the first time. There were also ferns there, but they were WEIRD and TROPICAL.</li>
